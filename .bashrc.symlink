# this file gets run in two cases:
# 1. non-login interactive shell
# 2. remote shell (over ssh or similar)

# #2 happens when you run "ssh user@host bash" explicitly.
# in this case, /etc/bash.bashrc has not been previous executed (unlike #1).
# however, we assume that #2 is a recovery mode, so we don't want to do much.
# (also, my google-fu didn't find a way to distinguish them)

# In case 2., .bashrc is also run for scp, which is non-interactive.
# Letâ€™s check explicitly here if the shell really is interactive.
